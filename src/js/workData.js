I had read some documentation on ES6 and fiddled around with it when I had free time, but nothing intensive. There was no better time than now. After gathering the requirements from our development team I mocked up the protoype in Adobe Photoshop in order to visualize what technologies I would need to incorporate. In order to produce efficient code I used Gulp as my task-runner. I love Gulp because because there is a plugin for everything (i.e. compiling SCSS to CSS, ES6 to ES5, minifying, etc...)</p>',

The site needed to be responsive so it could work on a variety of devices, especially mobile and it needed to be compatible with modern browsers such as Chrome and Firefox. I decided to use Bootstrap as it would provide the functionality that users would need.</p>',
			'<p>After getting the layout completed and tested on multiple devices and browsers I moved on to the interface. I adopted a simple flat design along with a color scheme that fell in line with the company brand guidelines. When used prudently, animations can provide a sense of intuition and interactivty that augments UX. I used jQuery to add effects for elements like buttons and menus.</p>',
			'<p>Using Gulp I improved the efficiency of the code by minifying the CSS and HTML, uglifying the JavaScript and then bundling the code together.</p>',
			'<h3 class="u-heading-6">04. Launch</h3>',
			'<p>For the launch, I had the site tested by our Quality Assurance and User Acceptance Testing teams before it was deployed. I developed several test cases that the teams would use to check for bugs.</p>'

I learned how to interact with people who may not be having the best day, managing expecations and working with them to deliver solutions. I met great people all around the country, even the world and it is an experience I will carry with me the rest of my life.</p>',

My job was to design the site and after creating some UI mockups in PhotoShop we were set on a layout.</p>',

It contained all the information anyone would ever need on a specific turbine. A process was setup where an event listener would pull up the info of the turbine name that was clicked. Bootstrap was used as it had a grid layout that was extremely useful for presenting this kind of information as well as for being responsive.</p>',
